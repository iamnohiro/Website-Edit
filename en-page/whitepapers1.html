                <p class="paracom_style">
                        
   						The account on the smart machine went back more than
                        half a century ago. Following that, is the emergence of
                        futuristic-themed films that featured revolutionary fictional
                        devices. Nowadays, as technology advances and smart
                        machines take the spotlight, devices that are seen only in
                        science fiction movies are now becoming basic and
                        essential part of human life.<br />
						<br />
                        
                        One of mankind's greatest assets is the ability to create logical solutions. Logic and mathematics always come together to derive a solution to a problem, be it something that requires physical work or mere systems of thinking. Of course, we always want to make life easier. In an attempt to avoid the tedious process of manual labor, man invented a system of doing things mechanically instead of manually. Since then, several inspiring innovations are introduced in this age of technological progress.

               <p class="paracom_style">     
                   When the Internet started in the 1950s, it only connected computers into a global network of computers. Now the Internet of Things (IoT) connects not just computer systems, but people, objects and practically anything that has a given unique identifier. <b>
<a href="http://parlacom.net.br/en/index.html" target="_blank">Machine-to-machine (M2M)</a></b> communication comes into
                    play by determining how the Internet is expanded with an
                    array of equipment such as sensors, communication
                    devices, even <b>wearable technology</b>, to maximize
                    utilization, improve lives and create opportunities for
                    business and profit.
                    
                    
                   Machine-to-machine technology (M2M) is all about People and Machines.
                   This is a time where communication is driven by
                    machines, particularly consumer devices communicating
                    with people and other devices. A person can gather data
                    and valuable information from these interactions
                    
                    The data can be used in various applications. Devices
                    can also be linked to other computers and they can
                    communicate independently without human intervention,
                    allowing <b>machine-to-machine, machine-to-mobile,
                    mobile-to-machine communication</b>.
                    
                    M2M can exist in almost any environment and can used
                    in any industry. Successful implementations include, but
                    are not limited to, mobile communication devices, natural
                    gas utilities, remote health management as well as sales
                    automation and management among others.<br />
<br />
					Human beings are very adaptable. With the rapid changes in consumer electronics and the development of new technology almost every day, consumers are adapting to these changes rather well. In fact, consumers are expecting more from the products that they buy. If machines are getting smart, so as humans.

			M2M presence is also rapidly growing in the Latin American Market, Brazil is the newest open market. As one of the largest countries in terms of population, Brazil is attracting a great deal of investors targeting the M2M space.

And as fast as the medical field is evolving, the need for better equipment to gather and transmit data is growing as well. Smart mobile applications have allowed caregiver and home care providers to have access to treatment and pertinent patient information even when not on site. Wearable devices for fitness tracking and emergency response are now made available in the market, apart from smart watches, smart shoes, smart socks, etc. Wearable technology is slowly reshaping the consumer world and greatly affecting fashion trends. And there is more to come.<br />

However, LeadingQuest sees the potential of extending beyond simple connectivity and extending it anywhere in the world. New opportunities for improving currently deployed applications are welcome challenges for developers and providers alike. Nonetheless, LeadingQuest understands these demands and acknowledges the potential for more cost-effective, revenue generating solutions.<br />
